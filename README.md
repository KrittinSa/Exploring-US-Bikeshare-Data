### Project Title
Exploring US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I had to make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United
States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I had to write code to (a) import the data and answer interesting
questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, and (b) write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive
experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
- washington.csv

- new_york_city.csv
